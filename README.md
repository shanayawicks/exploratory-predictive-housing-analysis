# Exploratory and Predictive Housing Analysis

This project explores housing data from Cook County, Illinois, through two phases of analysis: an exploratory phase and a predictive modeling phase. The goal is to better understand patterns in the dataset and build a predictive model for housing values using linear regression techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🧪 Project A1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and prepared a large housing dataset
- Explored the data structure and relationships between features
- Engineered new features and handled missing values
- Identified key variables that might contribute to predictive modeling

### 📈 Project A2: Predictive Modeling
- Built a linear regression model to predict housing prices
- Evaluated the model using metrics like RMSE and R²
- Analyzed model performance across demographic and geographic groups
- Suggested improvements and further directions for model tuning

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
